# Image Crop + Rotate + Pad

Loads an image and applies one reusable **rotate → crop → pad** transform. Click **Open editor** for the full-screen canvas (**Save & close** keeps your edits; **Cancel** or Escape puts everything back, asking first if anything changed); normal queued and API execution use the saved widget values without needing the editor.

## Controls

- **Image source**: Pick an existing input image (the list previews the image under the pointer and filters as you type) or click **Upload** in the compact
  source card, or drop an image file anywhere on the node. The original `image`
  widget remains the saved/API value; the old picker and upload rows are hidden.
- **Rotate → Degrees** (`rotation_degrees`): Clockwise rotation before crop and padding.
- **crop_aspect_ratio**: Free crop, source ratio, or a fixed ratio.
- **crop_x / crop_y / crop_width / crop_height**: Crop in rotated-image pixels. Width and height `0` mean the full available dimension.
- **pad_left / pad_top / pad_right / pad_bottom**: New pixels around the crop.
- **feather**: Feathers the mask into kept pixels, so a masked sampler and the stitch blend the seam. The image itself keeps a hard edge against the fill - the solid, hard-edged band that outpaint models and LoRAs recognise as the area to paint.
- **Divisible by** (`canvas_multiple`): Adds a few pixels of fill on the right and bottom so the width and height divide evenly by this number. Some models need sizes divisible by 8, 16 or 32; `1` turns it off. Its arrows go 1, 8, 16, 24 and so on; Shift steps by 1.
- **Fill** (`fill_color`): `#RRGGBB` or three RGB values used for generated pixels.
- **Resize output → Resize / Megapixels / Method / Step** (`resize_to_megapixels` / `megapixels` / `resize_method` / `resolution_steps`): Optional resize of the finished output to a pixel budget, with core *Scale Image to Total Pixels* semantics — the budget is `megapixels × 1024 × 1024`, aspect is preserved, and each dimension rounds to a multiple of **Step** (8 or 64 keeps VAE-friendly sizes). The image uses the chosen **Method**; the mask always resizes bilinear so feathered edges cannot ring.

## On the node

Tap a ratio under the preview to pad the picture to it: every pixel stays and
fill bands are added around it, centred. Set **Fit** to crop and the ratio trims
the picture instead. Tap the lit ratio again to go back to the whole picture.
**Fit** only acts on a lit ratio, so it is dimmed and says "pick a ratio first"
until you tap one.

Need a ratio no button shows? Type it in the **W:H** box next to the buttons,
width then height, and press Enter: `8,9`, `8:9` and `8x9` all mean 8:9. It
works like a ratio button and stays lit while the canvas has that shape. Clear
the box to go back to the whole picture.

- **A lit ratio is the shape the canvas has now.** Drag a handle to another
  shape and the ratio goes dark; the row says **Custom** and the size line under
  the picture gives the real ratio (`1.49:1`).
- **A picture that already has the shape gets nothing added.** Within about 1%
  counts, so a nearly 9:16 photo gets no 1 px band. The size line under the
  picture says so ("already 9:16: pick another ratio or turn it"), and while a
  ratio is lit it names it where it acted (`pad to 16:9 2532×1424`). A lit ratio
  saved in a workflow is used again on every new picture you load.
- **The padlock** at the end of the row keeps the shape while you drag: pull one
  side out and the other side's padding follows, split evenly. The row says
  **Held** while it is on. On the untouched picture (the row says **Source**)
  there is no shape to hold, so it stays off. **Reset** and tapping the lit ratio
  turn it off, and **Reset crop** also takes away the bands it added.
- **The orientation button** at the start of the row turns the shape on its side:
  16:9 becomes 9:16, padded around the picture (crop mode turns the crop box
  about its centre). The picture itself never rotates. With nothing picked it
  only turns the ratios, so the next tap goes that way.
- **Drag the picture itself** to move it inside its padding; the canvas keeps its
  size. Over the picture, the cursor and small arrows show which ways it can go.
- Rotating keeps a lit ratio: the padding follows the turned picture.

### Corner handles and Centre

The four orange corners outside the picture make the whole canvas bigger or
smaller and keep its shape: drag one out to add room on two sides at once, for
example to zoom out before an outpaint. The corner across from the one you drag
stays where it is. Hold **Alt** (Option on a Mac) while you drag to change all four
sides at once, so the picture keeps its place in the middle. You can press or let
go of Alt during the drag. A corner stops when one of its two sides has no padding
left to take away.

The two **Centre** buttons next to Fill, Feather and Resize put the picture in
the middle of the canvas: one side to side, one top to bottom. They move padding from
one side to the other, so the canvas keeps its size and a lit ratio stays lit. A
button is dimmed when the picture is already in the middle or that way has no
padding to move. On a narrow node they sit on a line of their own.

The orange diamonds move one side at a time, and the padlock works on them as
described above. The corners keep the shape with or without the padlock. The
green rotate knob moves aside when a corner handle sits where it usually goes.
The editor has the same handles and a **Centre** row under **Padding & mask**.

Technical details: a corner follows the pointer along the canvas diagonal, and
the shape it keeps is the canvas before **Divisible by** adds its fill. With
Divisible by on, **Centre** counts that strip on the right and bottom, so the
bands you see come out even.

**Divisible by** adds a few pixels of fill on the right and bottom so the width and
height divide evenly by the number you pick. Some models need sizes divisible by
8, 16 or 32; at 1 it is off.

The canvas row below holds **Fill**, the **Feather** amount in px, and the
**Resize** off | on switch. Turning Resize on opens a row with the **Megapixels**
budget and the **Step** each resized side rounds to; **Method** stays in the
editor, under **Resize output**. Added space on the picture is drawn in the real
fill colour with a faint hatch, and only the picture the crop cuts away is
darkened. **Reset crop** restores the full source crop without changing rotation
or padding. **Reset** clears rotation, crop and padding and turns the padlock
off; fill, feather and **Divisible by** stay.

The line under the picture names every step that sets the output size, in the
order the run applies them, with the size the run emits last and brightest:
`crop 2080×1170 → pad 2208×1298 → round to 64 2240×1344 → resize 1344×768`. A step
that changes nothing is left out. An amber line warns when rounding each side to
the Step stretches the picture by more than 1% (`1.5% taller: each side rounds to
32 px`); its tooltip names a Step that avoids it, and with Fit on pad, **Even
out** adds a few pixels of padding so nothing stretches. It also warns when the
resize undoes **Divisible by**. Hover the line for the same breakdown line by
line; the editor's right panel shows it too.

Fill, Feather and Resize stay synchronized with the editor. Changing the resize budget
updates the size readout immediately. Restoring a workflow or undoing a change
refreshes the source card and preview without resetting the saved framing.

## Drawing a mask

Right-click the node and choose **Open in MaskEditor** to paint over the parts
you want the model to repaint. After **Save**, the picture on the node shows
them in teal, and the teal moves with the picture when you crop, turn or pad
it. The full editor shows it too. The run treats painted parts like the
padding: it fills them with the fill colour and marks them in the **mask**,
so under the teal you see the fill colour, not your picture.

See-through parts of a PNG show in teal the same way, because the node paints
them too. To hide the teal, click the gear at the top right of the image
source box and turn off **Show the mask on the picture**. The choice applies
to every Image Crop + Rotate + Pad in this browser.

## Outputs

- **image**: BHWC float image batch. Animated image frames receive the identical transform.
- **mask**: White where the model paints: the padding, the empty corners a turn leaves, and the see-through parts of your picture.
- **stitcher**: Wire to Stitch Inpaint to restore the kept canvas around an outpaint result, blended into the source by **Blend** (32 px unless changed). It follows the final resized canvas.
- **original**: The loaded RGB image batch before rotation, crop, padding, or resize, with see-through parts shown as white. Existing image and mask sockets keep their positions.
- **width** / **height**: The output size after the transform and any resize.
- **prompt_image**: The image again, with see-through parts shown as white instead of the fill colour. Wire it to whatever writes your prompt. It is the same as **image** for a picture with no see-through parts.

## See-through pictures

A PNG can have see-through parts: a product cutout with no background, a
photo with round corners, a picture with a hole in it. The node treats those
parts like the padding. They are filled with the fill colour, marked in the
mask, and the model paints them. Stitch Inpaint never puts them back over
the painted result.

Use **prompt_image** for the node that writes your prompt. There the
see-through parts show as white, the way a picture viewer shows them, so the
prompt describes a real backdrop. Shown the gray fill instead, a prompt
writer calls it a "gray backdrop" and the model keeps the flat gray. The
model itself still gets **image**, with the fill colour it was trained on.

A picture with no see-through parts comes out exactly as before.

### Technical details

- A pixel counts as see-through when it is less than 90% as solid (alpha)
  as the most solid pixel in the picture. Measuring against the most solid
  pixel keeps a picture saved at, say, 50% opacity throughout whole instead
  of painting it over.
- A picture that is at least 90% solid everywhere is left exactly as it was
  loaded. Generated pictures often carry alpha values of 249-254 in places,
  and those pictures do not change.
- Kept pixels are used fully solid, in their own stored colour. See-through
  pixels never reach the canvas: their stored colour (often black, or the
  old background) is what used to leave a dark or light ring round a cutout.
- Why 90%: on an oval photo whose edge stores colours darkened by their
  alpha, a 50% cut kept a rim up to half dark, the ring the model painted
  back. At 90% the kept rim is at most 10% darker, and matting noise inside
  solid subjects stays above it, so no holes open there.
- A turned picture's see-through parts turn with it, like its corners. In
  **prompt_image** they show white while the padding and the corners keep
  the fill colour.
- The MaskEditor saves its mask as see-through parts of the picture, so the
  same rule applies: a stroke more than 10% strong is painted in full,
  including one at the MaskEditor's default 70% opacity.

## Inpaint & Stitch

The editor's right sidebar holds the stitcher's settings, the same as on the clip node:

- **Blend** (`stitch_blend`, default 32): the ramp, in output pixels, where generated
  pixels fade over the source. It is separate from **Feather**, which shapes the mask.
- **Show blend** tints the stage with the paste mask: the generated area (painted and
  see-through parts included), the feather, then grow and blend applied through any resize.
- **Advanced → Grow paste** (`stitch_grow`, default 0) moves the paste boundary first:
  a few positive pixels let the generation repaint the source edge when a seam still shows.

## Editor gestures

The editor's sidebar uses the node's own controls: the same ratio row with its
orientation button and padlock, the same **Fit** switch, and the same number boxes
(drag to scrub, click to type, Shift for fine steps: 0.1° on **Degrees**). Ratios you
added in `ausboss_presets.json` that no button shows are in a **More** list. A ratio
replaces the existing crop and padding and keeps rotation, fill and resize settings.
**Divisible by** and the resize **Step** can slightly change the fitted aspect. The size
box on the stage sits clear of the handles.

Drag cyan squares to resize the crop, drag inside to move it, orange diamonds to add padding on one side, orange corners to make the canvas bigger or smaller in its own shape (hold `Alt`, Option on a Mac, for all four sides), and the green handle to rotate. Hold `Shift` while rotating to snap to 15 degrees. The knob turns all the way round either way: past 180° it carries on from -180°, so an upside-down picture turns back up whichever way you drag. Rotating keeps the crop's size and keeps it over the same part of the picture, whichever control turns it (knob, number box, Reset rotation); with no crop the canvas grows to hold the tilted picture. The knob keeps clear of the padding handles and crop squares. Use the wheel to zoom and middle mouse or `Alt`-drag on an empty spot to pan. The same handles work directly on the node's compact preview (fit-only there — the wheel keeps zooming the graph); zoom and pan are editor-only.

The node performs no network requests and writes no files beyond a normal user-initiated ComfyUI upload.
